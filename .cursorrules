# Unread Backend - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
This is the backend for "[unread]" - a mobile-first platform for authors to share and readers to discover original ebooks.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase (separate dev/prod instances)
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage
- **Deployment**: Railway
- **Authentication**: JWT + OAuth (Google, Apple) - OAuth ONLY, no email/password

## Database Configuration

### Two Database Setup
- **Development Database**: Configured in `env.development`
  - Supabase project: `odrtvtmkapkqutgsmybf`
  - Used for local development and testing
- **Production Database**: Configured in `env.production` 
  - Supabase project: `jsxrkooqkdoiuwlzshoc`
  - Used for live application

### Migration Workflow
- Copy appropriate environment file to `.env` before running migrations
- Development: `cp env.development .env && alembic upgrade head`
- Production: `cp env.production .env && alembic upgrade head`
- Both databases should always be kept in sync

## Authentication - OAuth Only

### User Model (OAuth-Only)
- **NO email field** - users identified by OAuth IDs only
- **NO password field** - OAuth providers handle authentication
- Required: `username` (unique, editable)
- OAuth IDs: `google_id`, `apple_id` (at least one required)
- Profile: `avatar_url` from OAuth provider
- Timestamps: `created_at`, `updated_at`, `last_login`

### OAuth Providers
- **Google Sign-In**: ID token verification
- **Apple Sign-In**: ID token + authorization code verification
- **Account Linking**: Users can link multiple OAuth providers

## Code Style & Standards

### Python
- Use Python 3.11+
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Use async/await for all database and I/O operations
- Prefer Pydantic models for data validation
- Use dependency injection for database sessions and services

### File Organization
- Keep models in `app/models/`
- Keep API routes in `app/api/`
- Keep business logic in `app/services/`
- Keep database operations in `app/repositories/`
- Keep utilities in `app/utils/`
- Keep configuration in `app/core/`

### Naming Conventions
- Use snake_case for variables, functions, and file names
- Use PascalCase for classes and Pydantic models
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants
- Prefix private methods with underscore
- Use descriptive names for database tables and columns

### Database
- Use SQLAlchemy ORM with async support
- Always use database transactions for multi-step operations
- Use Alembic for database migrations
- Follow naming convention: tables in plural (users, ebooks, collections)
- Use UUIDs for primary keys where appropriate
- **Important**: Import all models in `app/models/__init__.py` for Alembic detection

### API Design
- Follow RESTful principles
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Use Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Group related endpoints using APIRouter
- Use dependency injection for authentication and authorization

### Security
- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Use environment variables for all configuration
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Validate all user inputs
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement rate limiting for public endpoints

### Error Handling
- Use custom exception classes
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately
- Return consistent error response format

### Testing
- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Use pytest with async support
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test both success and failure scenarios

## Key Features to Implement

### Core Entities
- Users (OAuth-only authentication)
- Ebooks (with metadata and files)
- Collections/Series
- Share Links
- Reading Progress

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- OAuth integration (Google, Apple) - ONLY
- Username-based user identification
- No email/password authentication

### File Management
- Ebook upload (EPUB, MOBI, PDF)
- Cover image upload
- File validation and processing
- Secure file storage with Supabase Storage

### API Endpoints Structure
```
/api/v1/
├── auth/          # OAuth authentication endpoints
├── users/         # User management (username-based)
├── ebooks/        # Ebook CRUD operations
├── collections/   # Collection management
├── shares/        # Share link generation
└── reading/       # Reading progress tracking
```

### Environment Variables Required
- DATABASE_URL (different for dev/prod)
- SUPABASE_URL (different for dev/prod)
- SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (different for dev/prod)
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY (different for dev/prod)
- JWT_SECRET_KEY
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
- APPLE_CLIENT_ID
- APPLE_CLIENT_SECRET

## Development Workflow
1. Create feature branches from main
2. Write tests before implementing features
3. Use black for code formatting
4. Use isort for import sorting
5. Run flake8 for linting
6. Ensure all tests pass before committing
7. Test migrations on development database first
8. Deploy migrations to production database after verification

## Deployment Notes
- Use Railway for hosting
- Set up environment variables in Railway dashboard
- Use separate Supabase projects for dev/prod
- Configure proper logging for production
- Set up health check endpoints

## Performance Considerations
- Use database indexing for frequently queried fields
- Implement caching for static data
- Use async operations for I/O bound tasks
- Optimize file upload/download processes
- Consider CDN for file delivery

## Commands and Testing
- Always use python3 for commands
- Database migrations: Copy appropriate env file to .env first
- Check database schema: `python3 check_db_schema.py`

## Future Enhancements
- Background job processing for file conversion
- Real-time notifications
- Analytics and reporting
- Payment integration
- Advanced search functionality
